### QSerialDevice ###
  * http://fireforge.net/projects/qserialdevice/
  * https://gitorious.org/qserialdevice

QSerialDevice is a promising project. At begining, Denis Shienkov want
to do some refactor for the QextSerialport, but then he find that if
he improve the coding following his mind, the result will be not
QextSerialport any more. So he create QSerialDevice project at Sept. 2009.

And now the project's name has changed to QtSerialPort, the author want to make
it a 3rd library of Qt5.

The repository is located at
  * ssh://codereview.qt-project.org:29418/playground/qtserialport.git

Qt Extended which is no longer supported by Nokia contains a QSerialPort class. Manual can be found from here:

  * ...
